# 🚀 Repair Hub

A full-stack, responsive repair shop web application built with **Next.js**, designed to showcase modern web development practices, clean UI/UX, and real-world CRUD functionality.

Demo, manage repairs, and explore how a production-style app works under the hood.

## 🧱 What It Is

**Repair Hub** is a clone-style project inspired by Dave Grayh’s Computer Repair Shop tutorial. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end web app with:

- Server-side rendering with Next.js  
- RESTful API routes (Node/Express-style handlers)  
- Persistent data management (local dev database → PostgreSQL/Neon in production)  
- Forms, validation, and dynamic routing  
- Clean, accessible UI  

This project is part demo, part learning sandbox — perfect for your resume or portfolio.
